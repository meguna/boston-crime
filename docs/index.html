			Crimes are categorized into "Part 1" and "Part 2" by the FBI's Uniform
			Crime Reporting Program. Part 1 crimes are generally more violent, and
			consist of: criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggrevated assault, 
			burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Specific definitions
			of these crimes are provided <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/appendices/appendix_02.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this map, crimes are clustered by location and the size of the dot
			represents the number of crimes in each cluster. (Specifically,
			the clusters are generated by the mini batch K-means method in SciKit Learn).
			As you zoom in, more precise data points are shown. At the smallest zoom level,
			the map shows all three hundred thousand+ data points.
